A larger part of the project revolved around loading in and reading out the .PGM ?les. I set up 2D arrays using an array of pointers. 
Setting one up for the image being read in, as well as the image to be written out. While reading in the image, the matrix dimensions were 
captured from the header to dynamically set up the 2D array.
